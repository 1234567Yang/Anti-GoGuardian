 ## Issues:
The code:
diff'''
if(document.getElementById("i1").src == document.getElementById("input1").value)
'''
seemed not work. the link of the page did not change. I do not know how to see if the website elements have been changed so the code did not work 100%.
If anyone could help me, please just send me a email or creat a pull requests. 
By the way, I am not good at JavaScript, I just learned some beginner code and my English is my second language, so there may be some gramma mistakes in this file, you can start a issues if you found one.

Thank you.
